thresholdsalt
=============
This repo contain my playground for threshold crypto on ed25519. I created [DualSalt](https://github.com/assaabloy-ppi/dualsalt) during work and later wanted to played around with with some threshold stuff in my spare time. If you are looking for some real code to use I recommend:
* [Multi-Party Threshold Signature Scheme](https://github.com/binance-chain/tss-lib) with nice MIT License.
* [Blockchain crypto MPC](https://github.com/unboundsecurity/blockchain-crypto-mpc) sadly is GPL-3.0 and is less friendly to use.
